I did my M.tech from NITK in 2010. Since I
had an inherent interest to pursue
teaching career, I joined an engineering
college as lecturer. To fulfil my yearning to
understand Indian philosophies, I joined
an year long course to study books like
Bhagavad-Gita. My desire to explore
teaching field took me to train myself in
high-school teaching and teach students
in mathematics for a couple of years. As I
taught and thereby learnt maths from
various perspectives, my inner interest to
dive deeper into study and research in
math and computation surfaced and grew
stronger, which brought me to CDS
